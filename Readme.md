# ðŸ“Š RFM Analysis: Customer Profiling and Segmentation

## ðŸ“˜ Project Overview

This project performs RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis to segment customers based on their purchase behavior. The goal is to profile customers into meaningful groups to help businesses target marketing efforts and improve customer retention.

The dataset used includes transaction details and customer purchase history, allowing calculation of RFM scores.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset Description

The dataset contains the following key components:

- **Customer ID**: Unique identifier for each customer
- **Recency**: How recently the customer made a purchase (days)
- **Frequency**: How often the customer makes purchases
- **Monetary**: How much money the customer spends
- **Segment**: Customer segment based on RFM scores (e.g., Loyal, At Risk)

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language  
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Data manipulation and calculations  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization  
- **Scikit-learn**: For clustering and scoring  
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive analysis and presentation

## ðŸ§ª Analysis Workflow

1. **Data Loading**: Load customer transaction data and profiles.  
2. **Data Preparation**: Clean data, calculate RFM metrics for each customer.  
3. **RFM Scoring**: Assign scores for Recency, Frequency, and Monetary values.  
4. **Customer Segmentation**: Define customer segments based on RFM scores.  
5. **Visualization**: Create charts and heatmaps to visualize segments and insights.  
6. **Interpretation**: Analyze segments to derive actionable marketing strategies.
